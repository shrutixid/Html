     <h1>Essentials of proffesional communication</h1> <br>
     <p>Good communication skills are crucial to any profession and any professional duties. Whether sitting in a 
        meeting, attending an interview, or sending an email to a client, communication is of vital importance.
         Professional communication is defined as oral, written, digital, or visual forms of information delivery in a 
         workplace. Professional communication also involves various forms of speaking, writing, and responding within
         and beyond the workplace environment. It is used in memos, letters, business proposals, and press releases. <br>

        However, the ways in which people engage with colleagues, clients, and business
         partners has shifted steadily. People no longer have to be in the same office, building, or even country to do
          business together. These changes have only made effective professional communication more crucial. Poor
           communication in the business world could lead to loss of money, energy, opportunity, and time.</p>
