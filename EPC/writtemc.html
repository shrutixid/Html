        Written Communication
        Definition: The Written Communication refers to the process of conveying a message through the written symbols.
        In other words, any message exchanged between two or more persons that make use of written words is called as
        written communication. <br>


        The written communication is the most common and effective mode of business communication. In any organization,
        the electronic mails, memos, reports, documents, letters, journals, job descriptions, employee manuals, etc. are
        some of the commonly used forms of written communication. <br>

        Such communication is used when the information to be transmitted is lengthy and includes some complex terms
        that cannot be explained verbally. Also, the organizations maintain their documents in writings such that these
        can be used as a reference and evidence of any transaction anytime in the future. Thus, it is essential for
        every business organization to develop effective writing skills and inculcate this in all its employees. <br>

     <hr><h2>Writting Process and strategies</h2>
    <p>Good academic writing requires effective planning, drafting, and revision. <br>

        The writing process looks different for everyone, but there are five basic steps that will help you structure
        your time when writing any kind of text. <br>

        <u><b>Step 1: Prewriting</b></u> <br>
        Before you start writing, you need to decide exactly what you’ll write about and do the necessary research. <br>

        <b>Coming up with a topic and doig research</b> <br>
        If you have to come up with your own topic for an assignment, think of what you’ve covered in class— is there a
        particular area that intrigued, interested, or even confused you? Topics that left you with additional questions
        are perfect, as these are questions you can explore in your writing. <br>
        <u><b> Step 2: Planning and outlining</b><br></u>
        Especially in academic writing, it’s important to use a logical structure to convey information effectively.
        It’s far better to plan this out in advance than to try to work out your structure once you’ve already begun
        writing. <br>

        Creating an essay outline is a useful way to plan out your structure before you start writing. This should help
        you work out the main ideas you want to focus on and how you’ll organize them. The outline doesn’t have to be
        final—it’s okay if your structure changes throughout the writing process.

        Use bullet points or numbering to make your structure clear at a glance. Even for a short text that won’t use
        headings, it’s useful to summarize what you’ll discuss in each paragraph. <br>
       <u> <b> Step 3: Writing a first draft</b></u><br>
        Once you have a clear idea of your structure, it’s time to produce a full first draft.

        This process can be quite non-linear. For example, it’s reasonable to begin writing with the main body of the
        text, saving the introduction for later once you have a clearer idea of the text you’re introducing.

        To give structure to your writing, use your outline as a framework. Make sure that each paragraph has a clear
        central focus that relates to your overall argument. <br>

      <u><b> Step 4: Redrafting and revising </b></u> <br>
        Now it’s time to look critically at your first draft and find potential areas for improvement. Redrafting means
        substantially adding or removing content, while revising involves making changes to structure and reformulating
        arguments. <br>

        Evaluating the first draft <br>
       <b> Redrafting and revising</b><br>
        Once you’ve decided where changes are needed, make the big changes first, as these are likely to have knock-on
        effects on the rest. Depending on what your text needs, this step might involve: <br>

       : Making changes to your overall argument. <br>
       : Reordering the text. <br>
       : Cutting parts of the text. <br>
       : Adding new text. <br>
       <u><b> Step 5: Editing and proofreading </b></u><br>
        Editing focuses on local concerns like clarity and sentence structure. Proofreading involves reading the text
        closely to remove typos and ensure stylistic consistency. <br>

         <b> Editing for grammar and clarity </b>
        When editing, you want to ensure your text is clear, concise, and grammatically correct. You’re looking out for: <br>

        :Grammatical errors. <br>
        :Ambiguous phrasings. <br>
        :Redundancy and repetition <br>.
