        <h1>What is Vocabulary?</h1>
        <p>Vocabulary (from the Latin for "name," also called wordstock, lexicon, and lexis) refers to all the words in
            a language that are understood by a particular person or group of people. There are two main types of
            vocabulary: active and passive. An active vocabulary consists of the words we understand and use in everyday
            speaking and writing. Passive
            vocabulary is made up of words that we may recognize but don't generally use in the course of normal
            communication.

    <h2> Measuring Vocabulary</h2>
    Exactly how many words are there in the English language? There's no real answer to that question. In order to reach
    a plausible total, there must be a consensus as to what constitutes actual vocabulary. <br><br>

    Editors of the 1989 edition of the Oxford English Dictionary reported that the reference work contained upwards of
    500,000 definitions. The average dictionary clocks it at about 100,000 entries. When you add it all up along with
    lists of geographical, zoological, botanical, and other specialized jargon, an imperfect but credible total for the
    number of words and word-like forms in present-day English is in excess of a billion words. <br><br>

    Likewise, the sum of a person's vocabulary is more than just the total number of words he or she knows. It also
    takes into account what people have experienced, reflected on, and either incorporated or rejected. As a result, the
    measure of vocabulary is fluid rather than fixed. <br>

    <p>Writers use words to compose sentences that develop ideas. A group of related sentences that develops a
        particular idea is organized in a unit called a paragraph. Understanding the basic concept of “paragraph” is
        easy enough, but applying that understanding—that is, writing strong, focused paragraphs—can pose challenges for
        writers of all levels of accomplishment. The discussion that follows will help you understand effective
        paragraphing and reinforce good writing habits. Keep in mind that writing is a process, and producing good
        writing, paragraph by paragraph, takes time. Learning to write effective paragraphs will help you communicate
        ideas clearly to an audience and help you achieve the purpose of the writing. <br>
    <h2>Qualities of an Effective Paragraph</h2>
    <b> Unity, Coherence, and Development</b><br>

    An effective paragraph will have unity, coherence, and development. Unity means that each sentence provides
    information that relates to the established focus of the paragraph. Coherence means each sentence logically leads to
    the next sentence, and the writer has provided transitions and guidewords to make the movement fluid for the reader
    and the different ideas come together cohesively. Lastly, development refers to sustaining and building the
    discussion by providing enough supporting details that the point of the paragraph is clearly communicated to an
    audience. While paragraph length can vary, effective paragraphs contain enough substantive content that readers do
    not have lingering questions. </p>
