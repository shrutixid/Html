   <center> <h1>Basics of grammer</h1>
    <p>
       <b>At a high level, the definition of grammar <i> is a system of rules that allow us to structure sentences</i>.
        <img src="https://writer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1-1024x459.png"  alt=""> <br>
        It includes several aspects of the English language, like:</b>  <br></center>

       : <b> Parts of speech </b>(verbs, adjectives, nouns, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, modifiers, etc.) <br>

       : <b> Clauses </b>(e.g. independent, dependent, compound) <br>

       : <b>Punctuation</b>  (like commas, semicolons, and periods — when applied to usage) <br>

       : <b> Mechanics of language </b>(like word order, semantics, and sentence structure) <br>

        Grammar’s wide scope can make proofreading difficult. And the dry, academic conversations that often revolve
        around it can make people’s eyes glaze over. But without these grammatical rules, chaos would ensue. So even if
        you aren’t a fan (and who really is?), it’s still important to understand.
